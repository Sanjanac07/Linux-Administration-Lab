# 🧮 Simple Calculator in C++ (Linux VirtualBox)

A simple calculator built using **C++**, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — inside a **Linux VirtualBox** environment.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates basic **C++ programming concepts** such as:
- Input and output operations
- Conditional statements (`switch`, `if-else`)
- Arithmetic operators
- Error handling (division by zero)

It’s a perfect beginner-level project to practice **C++ syntax and logic** while working inside a **Linux terminal**.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Perform basic arithmetic operations  
✅ Handles invalid operators gracefully  
✅ Prevents division by zero  
✅ Lightweight and runs entirely in the terminal
